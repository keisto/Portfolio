            Greetings, I'm a developer, and I have been developing since 2006. I haven't had a chance to make an entire career out of developing until now, but if I get the opportunity I won't squander it. For the past 4 years I have been working primarily in Laravel, Swift, and Java.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-loose">
            The most recent project I have been working on uses Laravel with a MySQL database. I designed API's to perform secure logins and share/update data. The data is shared with mobile companion applications for iOS and Android devices. This is a rather large project called Pylon that is still in development.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-loose">
            My mobile application Navo <span class="hint">(iOS)</span> has been updated to use Algolia's InstantSearch, GoogleAs, add Apple's StoreKit. Navo is an oil and gas locator application with over 1000 downloads in North Dakota <span class="hint">(targeted audience)</span>.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-loose">
            I will continue building up my portfolio to seize the dream job I desire. Stay a while, get to know me.
        </p>
